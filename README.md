# Getting started with Git and GitHub

### What is Git?
   - Version Control System for tracking changes in source code files

### What is GitHub?
   - Social code-hosting platform for version control and collaboration , you can even host websites for free
   
In other words, Git is the control system and GitHub is a hosting service for Git with enhanced features

### Concepts of Git

- Keeps track of code history
- Takes "snapshots" of your files
- We decide when to take a snapshot by making a "commit"
- We can always go back in time and see a snapshot of our code
- We can put our code in a staging area
- Use our terminal or Git Bash's terminal

Git is a stream of snapshots (commits)

### GitHub Essentials - Repositories and Branches

**Repository** - organizes a single project, they can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets and data sets

**Branching** - is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time
